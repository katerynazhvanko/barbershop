      "I loved how I look with my new hairstyle! It was my first time to experience their service. I was satisfied because he would be able to cut my hair that I wish to have. He also applied something that smoothened my hair and the fragrance was really good. I liked it so much! The pricing was affordable!",

I made the final decision after hearing his opinion and I am satisfied with the outcome. Itâ€™s different than what Iâ€™m used to, but in a good way!",
